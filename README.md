This Projects main goal was to develope a working web browser with privacy features.

In order to create a working Web browser a few key pieces of software need to achive this were: Intellij idea, PyQT5 , Flaticon.com, Google Programmable Search Engine, Wix Web Builder, OpenVPN.

The project first started off being named GodSpeed Search, this name has remaind after moving development over to Intellij Idea, To get the web browser up and running the module PYQT5 was used, as it was built with web browsing in mind. In addition to Intellij idea and PyQT5 being used Icons from Falticon were used for the buttons, this includes the search icon, the back button, the forward button, the reload button, etc, all icons can be found in Icons Folder of the project.

The Next part in creation fo the web browser was the use of Wix, a web site building platform, its use allowed us to create the landing page that the web browser opens to as well as the Home button links back to.There was the need for a useable seach bar and  to that end we went with using a Google Programmable Search Engine. This allowed for a Search bar to be embedded in to the Home Page of the search engine.

With the web frame work and the Search fuctionallity completed the last part needed for the project was the privacy feature, OpenVPN was chosen for its service. To this end we uses a service called Linode to host an OpenVPN server that GodSpeed Search can connected to for anonymous web browsing.
